scope over rides only work in this way:

$m = new Model;
$m = $m->scope("scope_name");

as the scope hooks are in the scope function.

provides:
extra fields to the wildfire dynamic content model to handle event data
a calendar model to generate an array for a months calendar
partial called __calendar to display a month along with logic for finding events that occur within that month (on a day or inbetween a range)
ics view & layout

this does not provide:
layout / view to handle listing of events
